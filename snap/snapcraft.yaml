  bcompare is a powerful time-saving utility for comparing files and
  folders.
  Use it to manage source code, keep folders in sync, compare program output,
  and validate copies of your data.  bcompare can create a snapshot of a
  live directory structure, and compare it against the live copy at a later
  date.
  bcompare helps you analyze differences in detail and carefully reconcile
  them.  It commands a wide range of file and text operations, as well as script
  commands for automating tasks.
